#Chocolate Sales Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
##Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design and develop a dynamic Excel dashboard that enables stakeholders to monitor, analyze, and interpret chocolate sales data effectively. By transforming raw transactional data into interactive visualizations, the dashboard aims to:

Track overall sales and profit/loss trends over time

Evaluate product-level performance to identify bestsellers and underperformers

Assess salesperson effectiveness based on contribution to revenue

Analyze regional sales trends to uncover geographic opportunities

Provide a user-friendly, interactive interface for real-time business insights

This project demonstrates how Excel can be leveraged as a powerful business intelligence tool for non-technical users and decision-makers.
